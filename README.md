## Welcome to Ampt!

[<img src="https://getampt.com/button"/>](https://ampt.dev/start?template=angular)

To run this app locally, simply clone down this repository and run `ampt`. You may need to login to the Ampt CLI if you haven't already (you can install this by running `npm install -g @ampt/cli`).

Happy coding!

# Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ampt dev` or `dev` in the Ampt shell for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ampt build` or `build` in the Ampt shell to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `static/` directory. This is modified from the default Angular build config, which stores the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory, storing in `static/` allows Ampt to serve the static files from the root of the domain.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
